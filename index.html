            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p>

                I have liked altoids for as long as I can remember.
                I always enjoyed their minty freshness and their satisfying crunch. My family would often get them for me as a treat.
                I remember the first time that I found someone else online with a similar facination. I was online playing games when
                someone in the game-lobby had the username "Altoid Addict." While I think using the word "addict" is obviously a humorous
                over exaggeration, I certainly related. The amount of altoids I consumed as a child was more than excessive. One time my mom got me a pack of
                three altoid tins for Christmas, and I ate the whole thing in a day. Nothing has ever come close to that amount of over consumption. 
                The nutritional facts of altoids state that each mint is approximately 3/4 sugar, meaning I consumed almost 200g of sugar in a single day.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item otherflavors">
            <h2>Other flavors</h2>
            <p>For me personally, I don't like any of the other flavors and types of altoids. The small atloids have the same flavor as the originals, sure,
                but not the same crunch. I never knew why I liked altoids until I read somewhere that what's addicting about them is the crunch. Ever since then 
                I haven't been able to unsee that crucial element in why altoids stand far and above other mint options. It's never the same.
                There are also the "colds" variant (which really was adopted from another company under the same parent company, and then rebranded as altoids). I only ever had once and they gave me a massive headache. No thanks.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item tastesovertime">
            <h2>Tastes over time</h2>
            <p>As I've gotten older, I have waned off the sweeter taste of some of the flavors of altoids. Wintergreen used to be my favorite flavor,
                but now I prefer cinnamon because its spicyness outweighs the sweetness of other flavors for something more "sophisticated." Maybe it's just because
                they are now ones I'm less familiar with that I like them more now. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item sours">
            <h2>Sours</h2>
            <p>When I first learned that there was a type of altoid that I had never had before, I was interested. That interest quickly turned into disappointment
                when I came to learn that the flavor I was seaking, sour altoids, was long discontinued. I can only go off first-hand accounts of what they were like, and apparently
                they left a satisfying burning after taste in the mouth that got people to come back to them again and again. I'm not sure why they were ever discontinued,
                and the official altoids website makes no mention of them. Who knows if they will ever come back. Probably not.
