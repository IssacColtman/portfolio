        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Issac Coltman. I made this website for my CS 110 class. I'm majoring in PPPM, a major program designed for those interested in urban planning, non profit management and public policy. I want to work in the public sector to make a difference in the legal and planning field. I believe that our cities can be improved greatly from how they are now, by moving away from cars and building more density, to put it short. I took CS 110 because I wanted to learn a little bit about programming, and be exposed to a new form of science that I haven't tried before. I have enjoyed my time during this class, even though I know now that programming most likely isn't for me. I'm glad to now know that!</p>
        <p>Some other things that I like to do, other that just my major, is to play piano and read about history. I also have accumilated quite the collection of house plants. I like trying to cook and bake new recipes, especially with my girlfriend. We also like traveling to new towns around the Pacific NW and talk about what we like and don't like-- I like to call it "Urban exploring." Finally, I'm also studying the Russian langauge (which my girlfriend also speaks) and I'm greatly enjoying my time with it! College so far has been a great time to explore new things and expand the realm of what I thought I could do. It's challenging for sure, because I have less comfortable things that I can fall back on, but also good for personal growth.</p>
        <p>Thanks for looking at my website. If you'd like, my resume is below.</p>
